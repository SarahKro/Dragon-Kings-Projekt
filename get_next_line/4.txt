	Herro Kyru, welcome to Shitty Riuru!!
1) get_next_line -> total_buffer -> read_from_file.
2) read_from_file -> make place for buffer with calloc so there is no memory problems.
3) first time for a memory control!
4) read from file.
5) if you find a '\n' in buffer decide what to do.
5.1) stop and print out?
5.2) before printing it out, need to concatonate every string until new line
5.3) so strjoin is a good idea to do it, i adjusted it to make a string even with one value.
5.4) when to stop?, how to?
6) free the buffer!
